Notes for future workshops:

1. Use basic tools first

	- This will make pre-workshop setup fast and easy

	- Demonstrating the purpose of each git command would be easy because ANYONE is probably used to the interface of Notepad or Notepad++.

	- The ultimate benefit of this is that the purpose of using other tools would be EVIDENT. 

	eg. Participant A realizes that he is taking too much time typing "git push origin master", "git pull", etc. or he's having a hard time to visualize the project's commits.

	This is the perfect time to introduce the person to a GUI like GitKraken or GitSavvy.

2. Explain each git command using metaphors 

   - the numerous commands of git are alot to take in so it's probably a good idea to explain it in "English".

   eg. commiting IS making another version of your stuff. This is better than making multiple files such as BattleOfYorktownEssay1, BattleOfYorktownEssay2
